# BMI Calculator

An application developed on the Android made to calculate a person's weight in pounds by their height in feet and inches. Upon pressing the ‘Calculate’ button, the app returns the BMI in numerical form and the state of the person’s body, being either Underweight, Normal, Overweight, or Obese.

For the technical aspects, if the user leaves even one EditText object in the application blank, the application will check, and if so, it will not calculate, so it will also not crash.

Coded mainly in Java, and developed in Android Studio.
